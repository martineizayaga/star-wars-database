## 📝 Specification
- [x] At least two (2) web components.

    I have an App component and a CharacterTable component.
- [x] Pass data between components.

    I pass the chosen character name, person data, and film data.
- [x] Character description should be a combination of your own words plus the Character’s data

   I included the height or weight of the character and the number of films they were in.
- [x] Style the movie list to look like a table. Even and Odd rows should have their own style.

    Check. I chose to use a Table API, but I still had to code in the even-odd CSS rule.
- [x] The application should be responsive (breaking point – mobile friendly).

    Check. Tested on mobile with Chrome Web Inspector.
- [x] Use at least one (1) DOM event.

    There's an onChange event for the character input (and there's also an onClick event for an easter egg of sorts shhhh don't tell anyone 👀.)
- [x] Use iteration whenever is possible.

    I initially was just using the [Ant Design UI library](https://ant.design/). Once I got a minimum viable product I wanted to see if I could get the dropdown functionality with just basic HTML, CSS, and JS. I found that you can use an input text tag and a datalist tag to make that happen. [This Codepen](https://codepen.io/BTM/pen/ZKxKPo?editors=1111) was very helpful.
    
   I've made some design Sketches below
